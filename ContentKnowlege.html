						I am using the AP History Unit 1 and 2 Folder project to demonstrate my ability to build strong content knowledge. In this assignment I had to draw a cover which represented information we learned on world history from the paleolithic era to the end of the classical era. Then on the first page I had to develop questions and answers based on the key concepts of chapters 1-7. That is 43 questions and answers. Then, on the next page I made a SPICE chart of key ideas I learned about from chapter 1 to chapter 7. On the last page of the folder project I made a timeline from the paleolithic era to 600 C.E.
						This demonstrates my growth in building strong content knowledge because in the beginning of the school year I had no idea what things such as “The Secondary Products Revolution” where, but now I have an understanding of almost all the major events which occurred from the paleolithic era to 600 C.E. This proves that I am gaining the ability to build content knowledge because I am learning new information, remembering it, and then using it. This assignment has shown me new and better ways to organize my knowledge and study. This means that I am getting better and better at building strong content knowledge.
						Currently, I give myself an A in this area. I give myself an A because I have become proficient in my knowledge of history from the paleolithic era to 600 C.E. through research and study. I have also achieved this by reading the AP textbook thoroughly. I also give myself an A because I can share information with others. My goal for next semester is to continue building my content knowledge because the only way I will pass the AP testing is if I have a strong understanding and knowledge of history.
